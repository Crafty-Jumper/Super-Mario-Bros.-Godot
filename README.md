# Super-Mario-Bros.-Godot
A remake of super mario bros made in the godot game engine.

# Why this game?
Well, it's iconic. It's super popular. And, It's fun.

# New stuff?
**Yes!** There's a settings menu, new levels and level packs, minigames, characters, and so much more. You can even add your own level packs with the template in the path main/Level Data/Template. There's a guide there so I won't talk about that here.
